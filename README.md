BrainTool is a Chrome extension that can be used as a unique bookmarks/tabs manager but which also synchronizes with a plain text emacs org-mode style file on your Google Drive to become a more all encompassing personal knowledge management tool.

The BrainTool panel in Chrome uses the org-mode tree structure but concentrates on the links within your notes thus unifying, at least for me, two primary ways to capture information.

Currently it is at a minimal MVP-for-me level of functionality so I have not yet published it. That said I'd love comments from a handful of early adopters.

If you want to try it, clone the [repo](https://github.com/tconfrey/BrainTool) and create it as a local extension:
- open [chrome extensions](chrome://extensions)
- toggle developer mode on
- click the "Load unpacked" button and point to the extension code location (/BrainTool/extension)
- the extension now shows as an icon in your tool bar
- click the ![icon](/extension/images/BrainTool16.png) icon!

There's more info in the [Overview](http://braintool.org/overview). Let me know if you have any thoughts, comments, or feedback.
